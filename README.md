# Redpoll

Redpoll is a custom, ergonomic (column-staggered), handwired bluetooth keyboard (in the state of becoming). It is powered by a nice!nano v2 running the [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/). 

I took ~~several~~ too many tries to set ZMK up for my keyboard. I hope fellow handwirers may find this useful.
