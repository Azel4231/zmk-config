# Redpoll

Redpoll is a custom ergonomic keyboard:

* unibody split
* column-staggered
* low-profile
* wireless, powered by a nice!nano v2 running the [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev/)
* handwired

It took ~~several~~ too many tries to set up the ZMK config for my keyboard. I hope fellow handwirers may find this useful.

## Name

The name is derived from the bird species called "common redpoll". I chose this name because:

* the overall keyboard shape and the plate design in particular reminds me of a bird
* the keyboard is designed to be portable (lightweight, slim) which corresponds to the redpoll being a (partly) migratory bird
* the keyboard case is constructed from birch plywood and the redpoll's life is closely connected to birches. So close in fact, that the german name is derived from it ("Birkenzeisig").
